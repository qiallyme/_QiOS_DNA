# Decision 0006: Clean Core with Legacy Bridge

## Context
QiLife is replacing an older Supabase-backed system that has a messy schema.

## Decision
QiLife will use a clean canonical schema locally in SQLite, avoiding inheritance of the old Supabase schema chaos. A Legacy Data Bridge will be built to map and selectively import useful records as legacy QiBits.

## Consequences
- Supabase is no longer the runtime source of truth.
- We need explicit bridge tables (`legacy_sources`, `legacy_tables`, etc.).
- The core data model remains clean and agent-friendly.
